#comments in python are started with a #
#testing out the print statements
print ("Hello World!")
print ("My Name is Miles Lacek")
print ("I am 30 years old and I love to bike")
# expected results in terminal is the print statements to read as they are above. CHECK 
# python 2 and python 3 are similar but syntax for python 3 uses parantheses

print ("Miles" + "Lacek") # joins the two strings together without space
print ("Miles Lacek") # prints the string just as is with a space
