#comments in python are started with a #.
#testing out the print statements.

# PRINT STATEMENTS
print ("Hello World!")
print ("My Name is Miles Lacek")
print ("I am 30 years old and I love to bike")
# expected results in terminal is the print statements to read as they are above. CHECK.
# python 2 and python 3 are similar but syntax for python 3 uses parantheses.

# CONCATENATION 
print ("Miles" + "Lacek") # joins the two strings together without space.
print ("Miles " + "Lacek") # joins the two strings BUT has a space after the first string with a space after "Miles ". 

# VARIABLES
todays_date = "January 29th" # todays_date has been given the value of the string.

# the value of quotient2 is 3.5

quotient3 = 7./2.

#An alternative way is to use the float() method:
quotient1 = float(7)/2
# the value of quotient1 is 3.5
